## Why SaQle

I come from an intense background of building customer facing applications, where half baked change requests come so often that before you finish a feature
you are throwing it out of the window to start another one.

Having worked with c# Entity Framework, Python's Django and FastApi, PhP's Laravel and Cake, I wanted to see if I could build my own custom framework, one that 
could support rapid protoyping. PhP being my first language, it was a go to choice.

So this is fun personal project that, more than anything else, has made me learn a lot of good software engineering techniques I can always transfer from project to project.

## Convention over Configuration

The framework relies heavily on convention rather than configuration to get your idea working as fast as possible. The conventions applicable will be pointed out alongside other recommended practices to get the best out of this framework.

## How To Contribute

There is so much that is needed to be done to make the framework stand alongside Laravel and other established PHP frameworks.
If contributing to open source excites you, or you just want to learn, reach out using the email address above and let's talk.

## Why SaQle

I come from an intense background of building customer facing applications, where half baked change requests come so often that before you finish a feature
you are throwing it out of the window to start another one.

Having worked with c# Entity Framework, Python's Django and FastApi, PhP's Laravel and Cake, I wanted to see if I could build my own custom framework, one that 
could support rapid protoyping. PhP being my first language, it was a go to choice.

So this is fun personal project that, more than anything else, has made me learn a lot of good software engineering techniques I can always transfer from project to project.
